# Node Package Manager
## Introduction
In this repository you'll find my personal practice for the course Dependencies and Packages Management in [Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/npm).

## General Info
During the course, we've learned the basics about Node Package Management. The goal of the code you'll find in this repo was to create my first own package for NPM.
If anyone feels like adding or improving something, feel free to do so!

## Setup
In order to get install the dependencies found in package.json you need to run the command `npm install`.
After you've done that, you can simply run the following command in your bash:

```
npm link
```

and to see what's been done, you only need to run `random`. 

**Have fun!**
